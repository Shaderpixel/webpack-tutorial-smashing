# webpack-tutorial-smashing
-files postfixed with -master comes from Joe's repo

Changes: 
	1. Updated Webpack to 2.6.1 as required by recent babel-loader versions, otherwise ES2015 code will not be transpiled down to ES5
	2. Webpack 2.6.1 requires absolute output path, used path.resolve to resolve path to dist
